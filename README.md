# Pair-Trading-

The code along with data used in my undergraduate thesis is presented in this repository. 

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, the implementation of pair selection was not included. However, code for generating daily pricing data for all the tickers in the S&P 500 is included in the notebook. Also, a zipped csv file containing the aforementioned S&P 500 data from January 1st 2000 to December 28th 2021 is included in this repository. 

A link to my thesis can be found in the notebook.
